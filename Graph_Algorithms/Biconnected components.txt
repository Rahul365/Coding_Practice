Biconnected  component : 
  1)if it is connected i.e. it is possible to reach every vertex from every other vertex
  2)even afer removing a vertex graph remains connected.

Simply a component is a biconnected component if it doesn't have any articulation points in it.
 
Given graph can have articulation points in it. 
To identify the biconnected components in the graph:
 1)use a stack 
 2)for each vertex 'u' do this : 
   2.i) //start dfs from unvisited node
    //keep pushing edges onto stack until articulation point occurs
    //if articulation point found
        while(!stk.empty() && stk.top()!= {u,v}){
            stk.pop();//pop the edges of the biconnected components
        }
        stk.pop();//to pop last edge of component {u,v}

  2.ii) for the remaining edges on the stack do the same thing
    //to pop the remaining edges of the connected components
        while(!stk.empty()){
            stk.pop();pop the edges of the biconnected components
        }
